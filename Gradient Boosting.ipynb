    "- Step 3: Now pass the independent features to the model by adding another tree sequentially but having R1 as the target variable\n",

    "- Step 5: Now calculate the overall model output as yhat + R2\n",
    "- Step 6: Now the model will look like it performs well but it has high variance and is overfitting\n",
    "- Step 7: Add a learning rate to reduce overfitting, which varies between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Step 8: Repeat the above steps continuously by adding more trees sequentially and the goal is to reduce the residuals to as low as possible\n",
    "- Step 9: Once training is done, the data has to pass through the base model and all the sequentially added trees to get the prediction"
